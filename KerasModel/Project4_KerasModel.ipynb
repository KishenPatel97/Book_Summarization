The 2016 home is the physical display that will culminate^ with an online video series on NextGen^ Home TV www.NGHTV.com,^ where Ty Pennington^ Several episodes will be produced showcasing various space saving strategies used throughout the house. At less than 900 square feet, the NextGen^ Healthy Home will be a whopping 1,700 square feet smaller than the average home built in the U.S. in 2014. \"This is an exciting opportunity for us, to be part of a showcase home that will exemplify^ two of the biggest trends in homebuilding^ today – smart and small. Energy efficiency is the outcome of a home designed to be smart, to work as an integrated system rather than many separate components. Covestro^ SPF^ systems help optimize the whole system,\" said Jeremy Parker The home will be open for tours at IBS^ 2016 in Las Vegas About Covestro^ LLC:^ Covestro^ LLC is one of the leading producers of high-performance polymers in North America Find more information at www.polyurethanes.covestro.com^ This press release is available for download from our website.

      "H: ANN7^ (DStv^ 405)^ in a statement now says Christina Aguilera^ dumped the South African 24-hour TV news channel's^ upcoming South African of the Year Awards because she is judging The Voice.^ The problem is that someone appears to be lying.^ The judges for the upcoming 9th season of The Voice on NBC starting on 21 September in the United States were announced back in July already and Christina Aguilera^ was replaced by Gwen Stefani^ who will be judging for her second season. UPDATE 27 September:^ Christina Aguilera^ is a judge on the 10th season of The Voice which will be broadcast in 2016 and although the 9th season just started on TV in America, the \"blind^ auditions\"^ for the 10th season is now being filmed with filming dates that were moved.^ And if it was true that Christina Aguilera^ is judging The Voice,^ why did ANN7^ and Infinity Media choose her initially and not do due diligence beforehand^ which would have revealed that Christina Aguilera^ is not signable^ for a live performance in South Africa because she will be a judge?^ It's all incredibly embarrassing for ANN7,^ the South African of the Year Awards and for Christina Aguilera.^ The reputation of a media outlet like ANN7^ which is in the news business is heavily based on values like honesty, transparency and above all credibility.^ This latest sudden about-turn^ and having to backtrack^ on announcements and making a mockery^ of what the South African of the Year Awards 2015 was announced as initially,^ once again dents^ and inflicts^ damage on whatever credibility ANN7^ has. \"Christina^ Aguilera^ has had to withdrawn due to a change in scheduling of the top-rated show The Voice on which she is one of the judges,\"^ says ANN7^ in a statement released on Friday morning. ANN7^ goes on: \"The schedule change requires her to be in the United States on the day of the South African of the Year Awards show.\"^ NBC in America has not made any schedule changes whatsoever to its schedule for the upcoming 9th season of The Voice - on which Christina Aguilera^ is not a judge. ANN7^ will now be refunding^ all tickets to those who've already bought tickets for the South African of the Year Awards 2015 set for 17 October at the Ticketpro^ Dome in Randburg,^ Johannesburg.^ The South African of the Year Awards 2015 will continue but will now suddenly become a private event. ANN7^ says \"anyone^ who has not heard from Ticketpro^ should call their call centre to ensure prompt refunding^ takes place\"^ Moegsien^ Williams, editor-in-chief for ANN7^ and SATY2015^ organiser says in a statement ANN7^ is \"deeply^ disappointed\"^ that it will suddenly no longer be able to bring Christina Aguilera^ to South Africa but that ANN7^ \"understands^ that she has contractual obligations that she must meet\".^ The South African of the Year Awards 2015 will still be a live broadcast on the channel on 17 October.\n",
