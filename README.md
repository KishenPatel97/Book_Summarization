# Book_Summarization
 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains one of the most popular applications of Machine learning today. Our project seeks to improve knowledge assimilation and learning through text summarization. 
In this project, we intend to use a python package called Stanza which is a collection of accurate and efficient tools natural languages. Stanza helps with processing raw text while carrying out syntactic analysis as well as entity recognition.
